I am a multidisciplinary programmer currently focused on *web* technologies.

Passionate about *technology* and *design*, I try to converge both skills through programming *websites* and *web applications*.

I had no previous programming experience, so it was hard to me to find a job in the sector. By this reason, I decided to create a portfolio on my own to show my skills and allow me to immerse myself in the industry.

My main programming languages &#8203;&#8203;are *JavaScript*, *HTML5*, *CSS3* and *PHP*
